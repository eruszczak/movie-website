Created for helping me with tracking watched movies/tv-shows.

If you rate again some title on IMDb, you will lose information about previous rating date and your rating.


## Plans
- [ ] Host it on my own VPS
- [ ] Custom domain name
- [ ] Use PostgreSQL instead of SQLite
- [ ] Allow other users to use it for their IMDb account
